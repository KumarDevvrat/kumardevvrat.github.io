<h2 id="first-things-first">First things first</h2>
<ul>
<li>An important assessment is to chalk out the time period for preparation. Software interviews are fairly difficult in senior positions in big companies. They also involve a fair bit of luck. Until you are solving <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">LeetCode</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> challenges daily, it&rsquo;s best to give yourself at-least one month or more</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to realize that the eventual goal is to become a good engineer, not rather someone who is only good at cracking interviews.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-other-topics">1.2. Other topics</h3>
<p>I had to prepare other two dimensions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience related questions</strong>: related to past projects, hard problems that one might have solved so on and so forth</li>
<li><strong>Personality related questions</strong>: related to working style, people management and leadership style, conflict resolution skills</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-time-allocation">2. Time allocation</h2>
<p>Of all the topics that have been mentioned, it&rsquo;s important to allocate time properly to maximize impact. A number of interviews will focus on problem-solving, hence solving for different kind of algorithm is more important than being thorough with compiler design</p>
<h2 id="3-learning-style">3. Learning style</h2>
<p>I am a huge fan of <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/">Fyenman learning technique</a>. My usual approach was</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a topic</li>
<li>Find out a credible learning source (such as video lectures, books). Now a days, there are incredible lecture series on YouTube or Udemy</li>
<li>Do as much internet research on concepts which are under-prepared. Deep-dive into those concepts until you are thorough on them</li>
<li>Write a mind-map and/or explain it to a panda in your house</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, specifically for algorithms and system-design</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice as much as you can on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">LeetCode</a> and/or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a></li>
<li>Practice end-to-end system design on variety of software&rsquo;s out there</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="31-practicing-system-design">3.1 Practicing system design</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s best if you can get a peer to review your design on whiteboard or while you explain to them. I tried to categorize many applications and practice those categories so I am covered</p>

<h2 id="4-learning-resources">4. Learning resources</h2>
<ol>
<li>I took the interview preparation kit of <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> and almost solved 50 percent of it. It was immensely useful for brushing up with concepts</li>
<li><a href="https://www.leetcode.com">Leetcode Premimum</a> was helpful in having mock tests of various difficulty levels.</li>
<li>Someone on LeetCode summarized <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/448285/List-of-questions-sorted-by-common-patterns">common patterns of algorithms</a> that are asked. It&rsquo;s a good grouping of problems</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&amp;list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O">Algorithms by Abdul Bari</a> is phenomenally well-explained course on algorithms. Highly recommended.</li>
<li>I took couple of courses on Udemy for revising <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/distributed-systems-cloud-computing-with-java/">distributed systems</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/operating-systems-from-scratch-part1/">operating systems</a>. They were quite good</li>
<li>On software architecture, this was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv7it-7j5Kc&amp;list=PLdsOZAx8I5umhnn5LLTNJbFgwA3xbycark">quick primer playlist</a> on Youtube by Mark Richards</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s best to reference videos of different conference where representations from different companies explain how they were able to solve key problems (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhARejRv_hg&amp;list=PLbRoZ5Rrl5ldRwunyzYNj1BfudZDorIlN">SRECon Americas</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s best to practice a lot, do a lot of Googling, deep-dive into topics with the help of books, blogs, intelligent StackOverflow questions and any other resources</p>
