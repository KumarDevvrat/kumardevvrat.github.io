			<h2 id="introspection">Introspection</h2>
<p>This is about re-assessing the problem solving approach. As we progress in our careers, we get efficient in finding solutions to daily problems.
The usual paradigm becomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the problem with knowledge acquired/known so far and with first principles</li>
<li>Solve the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>All this is fine as long as the problem statements don&rsquo;t vary often or remain in the same realm of complexity. If you are at a workplace wherein there are hard problems every now and then, this falls flat rather fast.</p>
<p>We acquire patterns and knowledge with repeating problem solving over the years. We notice people around us do the same and acquire their wisdom once in a while.  That is brilliant. However our knowledge gets confined to the problems that we solved and the patterns that we saw. This happens more as we progress and we get a false satisfaction of knowing enough.</p>
<p>With this introspection, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t spend enough time learning on</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous basis</li>
<li>During the first step of attacking any problem</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, I wish to re-orient my approach in my workplace or otherwise. I wish to</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend 15-30% percent of time learning, refining my thoughts, re-orienting my brain continuously</li>
<li>Re-orient the problem-solving approach
<ol>
<li>Learning about what others are doing (locally, peers and globally). Inspect academic texts that might be relevant. Dive-deep into other similar problems. Spend most of the time unraveling areas that I didn&rsquo;t even know</li>
<li>Analyze the problem with compounded knowledge and with first principles</li>
<li>Solve the problem</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am sure this paradigm is intuitive to most people. Having seen my fair share of problems, I have humility in accepting that I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t know many times. Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to make a deliberate attempt in re-assessing ourselves</p>
<h2 id="hobby-project">Hobby project</h2>
<p>In line with the above, I am considering spawning a short-term to medium-term hobby project. I will build it end-to-end. I wanted to choose a project that was</p>
<ol>
<li>Outside my current work domain so that I can learn and work on different things</li>
<li>Has scope of deep-diving into different areas of system design and other fields of computer science/engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>Without falling into analysis-paralysis, I have decided to spend my time building a trading simulator. I wrote a small trading engine back in the day and it was a lot of fun. A trading simulator will be intensive in all aspects hence it might be a decent choice</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see where this leads to!</p>
