title: A new start!
---

I am starting a new blog/site after a long time to put my things together or simply have an internet space of my own. I had purchased [devvrat.in](http://devvrat.in) back in 2010 and had written lot of stuff there. Unfortunately, it is all lost. I had hosted it on Wordpress at [x10Hosting](http://www.x10hosting.com). Wordpress had so many security exploits that I lost track of them. Every now and then, x10Hosting used to cancel my account and I used to plead them. At the end,  they terminated my account. I had backed up the wordpress install on my linux system from college but as it turns out that system is dead now. So well,  all the data is gone now!

I am trying to assemble this one by simple static generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It is tightly integrated with Github pages and I can simply write posts on `vim` and do `git push`. I find blogging with markdown syntax very slick.

It so happens that I am starting on 2^nd of April which is the start of the Hindu new year. For this year, apart from my desk job and startup ideas, I have clear cut learning goals. Let me see how that works out.
