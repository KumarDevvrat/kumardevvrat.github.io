        Setting up Linux again
      </a>
    </h1>

    <p>For quite sometime, I was really busy with my desk job. I am mostly involved in Java related technologies and churning out code on IntelliJ IDEA/Windows here but I was getting annoyed with the ecosystem outside IntelliJ. Setting up any software on windows and specially specific toolchain is painful. I manage a lot of CentOS servers though but the joy of using and developing on linux is very good.</p>

<p>So I decided to use a VM. I have seen VirtualBox crashing at weird times but I did decide to use it nevertheless. Until now, I was using my linux config and package list from the college laptop. I decided that it was too stale now and maybe I need to jump into making out my own system again.</p>

<p>I installed a vanilla Ubuntu 13.10 on the VM. There after it was easy</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Once setup, installed the following packages/software</p>

<ul>
<li>awesome</li>
<li>ZSH</li>
<li>terminator</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>guake</li>
<li>exuberant-ctags</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>vim-gnome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swap <code>Ctrl</code>/<code>Caps Lock</code> because my hands are configured that way. Plus it is quite easy to use vim and other tools that way. Use <code>xmodmap</code> to do that.</li>
<li>Setup oh-my-zsh and copy my old .zshrc files so that command line is all set</li>
<li>Setup quick shortcuts for guake (launch on <em>tilde</em>) and others as well</li>
<li>Make awesome as the default desktop manager</li>
<li>I decided to redo the vim config again. For the sane plugin management this time, I went with Vundle. It was very easy to set it up.</li>
</ol>


<p>I am past the days of setting up different desktop managers, installing new distros, compiling packages from source, getting those shiny gnome-shell customizations etc. Now I want a fast,  lightweight, no-nonsense working system. I have vim, zsh, guake, chrome and awesome. I feel good now.</p>

    <p>I am starting a new blog/site after a long time to put my things together or simply have an internet space of my own. I had purchased <a href="http://devvrat.in">devvrat.in</a> back in 2010 and had written lot of stuff there. Unfortunately, it is all lost. I had hosted it on Wordpress at <a href="http://www.x10hosting.com">x10Hosting</a>. Wordpress had so many security exploits that I lost track of them. Every now and then, x10Hosting used to cancel my account and I used to plead them. At the end,  they terminated my account. I had backed up the wordpress install on my linux system from college but as it turns out that system is dead now. So well,  all the data is gone now!</p>

<p>I am trying to assemble this one by simple static generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It is tightly integrated with Github pages and I can simply write posts on <code>vim</code> and do <code>git push</code>. I find blogging with markdown syntax very slick.</p>

<p>It so happens that I am starting on 2<sup>nd</sup> of April which is the start of the Hindu new year. For this year, apart from my desk job and startup ideas, I have clear cut learning goals. Let me see how that works out.</p>
