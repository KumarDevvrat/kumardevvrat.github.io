  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

  <p>I am a software engineer working right now in one of the big data firms. </p>
  <p>I love building complex systems. I have worked in multiple domains such as low-level networking stack, satellite communication, wireless protocols, large-scale software development in distributed system, IDE design and development (develop where people can develop!), web services, web application with database, caching and front end layers. Anything related to computer science and engineering, programming interests me.</p>

  <p>Problems with actual use-case excite me. I have keen interest in R&D, with equal emphasis on prototyping and developing. I like to think myself as perfectionist in the timelines.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>I take keen interest in learning and being proactive in:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Software architecture and design
      <li>Distributed systems
      <li>Operating systems
      <li>Functional programming
      <li>Networking
      <li>Programming language design and paradigms 
      <li>Data structures
  </ul>
  <p>I wish to become kernel programmer at some point in time. That said, I don't like hating writing server side codebases in Java either. I do whatever I want on my laptop as long as the problem space is challenging enough.</p>
  <h2>Random</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>I fill in my idle time following <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a> or playing <a href ="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>
      <li>Usability to the end user of a product is the single most important thing
      <li>Performance is a feature of the application not an add-on
      <li>Complexity and details are everything yet abstraction is fun and necessary and so is the bigger picture
      <li>Concepts are more important than technologies or languages
  </ul>
